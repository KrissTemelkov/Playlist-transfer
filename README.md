# Playlist-transfer
Description: A program that transfers playlist from Spotify to YouTube.
# Required:
- Python 3
- undetected_chromedriver
- Selenium
# TO MAKE THIS CODE WORK...
The code is made to work on my computer, which means sleep times are set for the loading speeds of my computer. For yours it might be too slow or fast. You might need to change "time.sleep(sec)" in order to work properly. In future versions I will fix this problem by using Selenium Waits instead of time.sleep().
# Known Bugs:
- if the first thing that appears after the search is a playlist it plays it and the song is not added to the playlist.
# LICENCE:
NOT FOR COMMERCIAL USE If you intend to use any of my code for commercial use please contact me and get my permission. If you intend to make money using any of my code please ask my permission.
